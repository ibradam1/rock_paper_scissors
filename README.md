Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors in Javascript

Problem: For a rock paper scissors game, we need the computer to select a
random choice of rock, paper or scissors. Then we need to get the player's choice.
Depending on the player's choice compared to the computer's, the player will 
either win, lose, or tie. This will make up one round. Finally, the 
program must play 5 rounds of this game that keeps score andd reports
a winner or loser at the end.
