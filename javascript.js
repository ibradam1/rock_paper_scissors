//Generate random choice for computer
    //Get a random number from 0 to 2
    //Assign each number to correspond to choice: 0=Rock, 1=Paper, 2=Scissors
    //Return computer's choice as a string





//Get player's choice
    //prompt for the player's choice
    //convert the player's choice to lowercase, then capitalize the first letter.
    //if the capitalized player's choice is not Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then promt again (repeat the loop)
    //return the player's choice





//Determine who wins the round
    //if player and computer pick the same, then its a tie.
